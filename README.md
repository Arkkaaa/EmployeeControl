# A Simple Localized Employee Controller</h1>
This application utilizes a java resource bundle to handle 3 different languages:</p>
- English
- Farsi
- Japanese

The ui will change the selected language based on the user's selection using a simple switch statement.

The database is set to support UTF-8 languages when appending user data to the db using sql characterset utf8mb4 & collation utf8mb4_unicode_ci.
